## CPU 
- is a Cyrix 6x86MX-PR266 (83MHz x2.5 2.9V) - https://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/6x86/Cyrix-6x86MX-PR266%20(83MHz%202.9V).html
- CPU speed jumpers:
  - S7: open
  - S8: closed
  - S9: open
  - S10: open
  - S11: open
  - S12: open
- Jumpers are set to Cyrix 6x86MX-PR233 200MHz 3.0x 66MHz open close open open open open
  - in factory config it should be 83MHz x2.5 = 208MHz

## Voltage
- I/O - 3.3V
- Core - 2.9V

- jumpers:
  - should be (and is on the image) set to 3.3V/2.9V:

    - S2: open
    - S3: open
    - S4: closed
    - S6: closed
